# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Setup my website to deploy to S3 via gitlab CI/CD. 

**Thoughts:** Glad the website is deploying automatically now, been on the TODO list for a while. Had most things in place already, just needed to hook up the gitlab ci thing. Struggled with the IAM policy for the s3 bucket, basic read write was not enough, so had to tweak it a few times. I really didn't want to give CI access to all buckets.
I have no real plan for the 100 days, will need to think about this more.
